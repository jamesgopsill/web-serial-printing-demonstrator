# Printing via Web Serial

This repo demonstrates how you can use Web Serial to control and send prints to your 3D printer. All through the browser!

Take it for a spin [here](https://jamesgopsill.github.io/web-serial-printing-demonstrator/).

**[TODO]**

## What next?

How about a fully-fledged slicer and control centre for your printer right in the browser? Or adding your printer to a Brokering Additive Manufacturing network?
